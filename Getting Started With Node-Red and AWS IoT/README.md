# Getting Started with Node-Red and AWS IoT #
<cr>

## Overview ##
Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online
services in new and interesting ways. Node-RED provides a browser-based
flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide
range nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the run-time in
a single-click. The light-weight run-time is built on Node.js, taking
full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it
ideal to run at the edge of the network. Amazon* Web Services (AWS IoT) is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS IoT, your applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time, even when they aren’t connected.  AWS IoT makes it easy to use AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, and Amazon DynamoDB to build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze and act on data generated by connected devices, without having to manage any infrastructure.

## Required Hardware ##
-   IoT Gateway that uses Intel® IoT Gateway Technology

## Assumptions ##
-   Intel® IoT Gateway Technology version 3.1 or above
-   Node.js is installed on the IoT Gateway (installed by default)
-   Node-RED node node-red-node-serialport is installed on the IoT Gateway (installed by default)
- AWS IoT package is installed on the IoT Gateway 
	- You can install this package by clicking on Packages and then Add Packages from the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub
-   Node-RED is installed on the IoT Gateway and is running (installed by default)

## Setting up AWS IoT ##
- Sign up for a new AWS IoT account by logging in with your existing Amazon account or creating a new one by visiting [https://aws.amazon.com/iot/]( https://aws.amazon.com/iot/)

- Click to start the interactive tutorial after you log in.

- Click to download the public key, private key and the certificate to your local computer.  Place them in a directory where you can find them in a future step.  These certificates are what authenticate the IoT gateway and allow it to send data to the AWS IoT cloud.

- Connect the ‘F to C’ node to the ‘AWS IoT send temp’ node.  This will take the temperature from the RH-USB sensor and send it to the AWS Cloud.
